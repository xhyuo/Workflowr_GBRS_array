Research website for GBRS_array.

# Goal
To evaluate the performance of GBRS by comparing its genoprob with arraybased genoprob (MUGA, MegaMUGA, and GigaMUGA).

# Approach
1. number of recombinations
2. pearson correlation between genoprobs
3. LODs on local eQTLs - accumulative and/or scatterplot

## Recombinations
* [Recombinations](Recombination.html)
* [Figure1](Figure1.html)

## Pearson correlation between genoprobs
* [Correlations](Correlation.html)
* [Figure2](Figure2.html)

## LODs on local eQTLs
* [Cis-eQTLs](Cis-eQTL.html)
